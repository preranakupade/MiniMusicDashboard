/**
 * IMPORTANT: This file shares the module-level "tracks" with pages/api/tracks.js
 * in real Next.js environment you may want a shared module. For simplicity in this assignment,
 * we'll re-import the list by reading from the same runtime memory — but in this example
 * we'll re-create the list to mirror the previous endpoint.
 *
 * A better approach is to move `tracks` into a small shared module (e.g. /data/tracks.js)
 * and import it from both endpoints. But to keep the example self-contained, we will
 * maintain the list by requiring the same file. For development this works because module
 * state persists while dev server is running.
